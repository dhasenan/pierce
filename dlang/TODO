Bugs:
* can't mark Eli Dupree's articles read
* "attribute must be quoted" errors (including in youtube feeds) ? (not reproducing?)
* trying to subscribe to a new feed that has errors when reading articles doesn't create
  subscription (and doesn't tell you there was a problem)
* subscribing to a feed doesn't refresh view
* need to set reasonable timeout on wget
* fail to find feeds at http://www.elidupree.com/main/atom.xml
* race conditions (need transactions in a few places)
* weirdness applying db migrations (hang on startup)

To check:
* trying to subscribe to the same feed twice gives you a db error (should no-op)

Fixed:
* mark older read
* too many open files (after running for several days)
* fail to find feeds at http://www.questionablecontent.net/QCRSS.xml: content type
* fail to find feeds at http://www.questionablecontent.net/QCRSS.xml: CDATA
* dates for display are all 1970-01-01
* fail to log in with newly imported account
* same article added many times
    Example: 18314624-14e1-49b4-83e2-977be572f413, 2078a670-cab0-4d48-96c8-d0450a2e1e2e
* logout doesn't reload the page
* logout doesn't clear session on the server
* missing icons for feeds
* label with no name instead of "Uncategorized"
* link goes to nowhere
* can't mark article read/unread (happens locally, not persisted)
