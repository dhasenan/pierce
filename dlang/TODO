Bugs:
* trying to subscribe to the same feed twice gives you a db error (should no-op)
* trying to subscribe to a new feed that has errors when reading articles doesn't create
  subscription (and doesn't tell you there was a problem)
* subscribing to a feed doesn't refresh view
* need to set reasonable timeout on wget
* fail to find feeds at http://www.elidupree.com/main/atom.xml
* race conditions (need transactions in a few places)

Fixed:
* fail to find feeds at http://www.questionablecontent.net/QCRSS.xml: content type
* fail to find feeds at http://www.questionablecontent.net/QCRSS.xml: CDATA
* dates for display are all 1970-01-01
