Things to look into eventually:

* Following a site that doesn't publish a feed
* More sort/filter options?
* What other data can we show?
* Annotating articles
* Attached media (<enclosure>)
* Change feed URL
  For things like schneier's blog feed change, if the unique ids for
  articles is consistent, this means you save history.
