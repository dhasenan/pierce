    nginx + fastcgi server + startstopdaemon is trivial

* Bugs:
  * Title doesn't update when reloading stuff (incl. read/unread count) from server (eg open in two
    locations)
  * Click on a feed in second label: highlights every copy of that feed
  * Reading an article doesn't update label read counts
  * Reading an article doesn't update title when selecting a label
  * Keyboard shortcuts interfere with popup inputs
  * RSS feed can't be read: xml parse error (feed contains ASCII 0x10 "data link escape")
  * Selected item sometimes loses selection styling.
  * All/unread filtering doesn't work with labels
	

Personal:
  * Feed list going all the way to the bottom
  * Reset scrolling for article area when switching articles
  * Scroll to current article when using keyboard shortcuts
  * Save/restore expanded feeds
  * Change feed url?
    Youtube feeds specifically.
  * Special youtube handling


Bugs:
  * Adding a feed doesn't seem to close the popup or update the feed list.
  * Unsubscribing from a feed doesn't clear its articles from the article list.
  * Article nav shortcuts don't pay attention to unread filtering
  * Article nav shortcuts don't move to next/previous label


Ugly:
  * Expander button doesn't switch (plus/minus)
  * Resize handles are 1px wide.
  * 'Articles', 'Article' labels don't update
  * Menu icon is small, not really clear what it's for
  * Popup/icon theme doesn't mesh with rest of site
  * 'Uncategorized' shows up even when all feeds have labels.
  * On load, all popups are briefly visible.


Code quality:
  * Unify atom / rss parsing
  * Clean up ui/domain


Public launch:
  * Uncaught exceptions to SMTP appender
    I think it's coded properly, but I have yet to see an exception email incoming.
  * Ajax loading gifs
  * OAuth
  * HTTPS
	* Article search
	* Authentication double-check
  * Error handling / feedback
    * Butter bar!
    * Don't show login window when we fail to contact server
  * Documentation
    * Usage
      * Help menu
      * Butter bar stuff
  * Nicer timespan editor than 'X minutes'
  * Update article list after updating feeds / subscribing (check)
  * Mobile-optimized site
  * Mark all|selected read
  * Reduce initialization network usage
    Send less data.
      Trim each feed to entries from the past 60 days, up to 100; or the past 25 articles from all
      time (for instance). Maybe give an option to fetch older data (up to 1 year / 1000 articles?).
    Send more compact data.
      Gzip it.
      Remove unused fields -- though the major component is the description, which we can't fully
      eliminate.
    Send less data initially.
      Send a list of everything but the articles at first, and add in the unread count.
      Click on something, you get it loaded from the server.
  * Reduce ongoing network usage.
    Only return the stuff that's newer than the last article you have.
    Only update stats etc.


Dissemination:
  * Packaging and deployment
  * Setup docs


Monetization:
* Need:
  * Better splash screen (login/register)
    Requires someone else to help.
  * Payment integration
  * Personal name
  * Update name / email / etc
  * Logging (SMTP appender for high severity errors)
  * Registration tracking
  * Performance tracking (request latency, etc) + alarms
  * Help
  * Security testing
* Interesting:
  * Youtube user following
  * Twitter following
  * G+ following (can only do public feed)
  * Facebook following (probably the same)
  * Annotating articles
  * More sort/filter options?
  * What other data can we show?
  * Following a site that doesn't publish a feed
  * Android / iOS app
