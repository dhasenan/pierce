Bugs:
  * Adding a feed doesn't seem to close the popup or update the feed list.
  * Click on a feed in second label: highlights every copy of that feed
  * Unsubscribing from a feed doesn't clear its articles from the article list.
  * Reading an article doesn't update label read counts
  * Reading an article doesn't update title when selecting a label
  * All labels start expanded


Ugly:
  * Resize handles are 1px wide.

  * Menu icon is small, not really clear what it's for
