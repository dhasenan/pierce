  * Ajax loading gifs
  * Mobile-optimized site
  * Clean up ui/domain
  * Mark unread
* Bugs:
  * Title doesn't update when reloading stuff (incl. read/unread count) from server (eg open in two
    locations)
  * Click on a feed in second label: highlights every copy of that feed
  * Reading an article doesn't update label read counts
  * Reading an article doesn't update title when selecting a label
  * Keyboard shortcuts interfere with popup inputs
  * RSS feed can't be read: xml parse error (feed contains ASCII 0x10 "data link escape")
  * Selected item sometimes loses selection styling.
  * All/unread filtering doesn't work with labels
  * When switching between articles, I have to click the article box to make arrow key scrolling
    work
  * Article nav shortcuts don't pay attention to unread filtering
  * Article nav shortcuts don't move to next/previous label
  * Article nav shortcuts don't ensure the selected article is visible when moving between feeds
  * Article nav is terribly slow.
  * URLs without a scheme specified result in an exception.
  * Subscribing to a feed when you're already subscribed: shows up twice in the feed list
  * Adding a feed doesn't seem to update the feed list.
  * Auth tokens are ephemeral and die whenever the server dies.
* Ugly:
  * On load, all popups are briefly visible.
  * Reset scrolling for article area when switching articles
  * Scroll to current article when using keyboard shortcuts
  * 'Articles' label doesn't update (should have the feed/label name)
  * 'Uncategorized' shows up even when all feeds have labels.
	

Personal:
  * Reduce ongoing network usage.
    Right now, it only reloads stuff that's been reread recently. That means an hour sitting idle
    will reload all your feeds with default settings. But a lot of feeds only get new articles once
    a day, or less often.
    * Only return the stuff that's newer than the last article you have.
    * Only update the minimum necessary to render the current view. Server-side maintenance of
      unread counts, for instance.
    Additionally, we keep the read message list for all time for all subscriptions.
    * Only keep the most recent 2*head_length in the subscription. (2MB limit; about 40 bytes per;
      that's 4KB + some overhead per subscription, meaning a person can have 450 subscriptions.)
    * Same head-and-chunk arrangement. This lets us track historical read/unread stuffs.


Bugs:
  * Clicking on articles whose feeds have been updated seems not to mark those articles as read
  * Unsubscribing from a feed doesn't clear its articles from the article list.
  * Items removed from a feed (eg Erutan uploads a video, we see that, she removes it) still show up.
    Mark articles as removed if they disappear from the feed while there are older articles still
    there? Reflect that in the UI somehow?
  * Navigation horked if you're moving between labels/feeds
  * Updates are slow at getting between two tabs open to the site.


Ugly:
  * Expander button doesn't switch (plus/minus)
  * Resize handles are 1px wide.
  * Menu icon is small, not really clear what it's for
  * Popup/icon theme doesn't mesh with rest of site
  * Ajax loading gifs are ugly


Code quality:
  * Unify atom / rss parsing EVEN MORE (hybrid feeds)
  * Switch layout state from cookie to local storage.


Public launch needs:
  * Uncaught exceptions to SMTP appender
    log4net is configured at this point, but my ec2 instance isn't getting stuff to my gmail account
  * OAuth
  * HTTPS
	* Authentication double-check
  * Security testing
  * Personal name
  * Update name / email / etc
  * Registration tracking
  * Performance tracking (request latency, etc) + alarms
  * Error handling / feedback
    * Butter bar!
    * Don't show login window when we fail to contact server
  * Documentation
    * Usage
      * Help menu
      * Butter bar stuff
  * Limit feeds per account


Public wants:
	* Article search
  * Nicer timespan editor than 'X minutes'
  * Update article list after updating feeds / subscribing (check)


Dissemination:
  * Packaging and deployment
  * Setup docs


Monetization:
* Need:
  * Splash screen (login/register)
  * Payment integration
* Interesting:
  * Youtube user following
  * Twitter following
  * G+ following (can only do public feed)
  * Facebook following (probably the same)
  * Annotating articles
  * More sort/filter options?
  * What other data can we show?
  * Following a site that doesn't publish a feed
  * Android / iOS app
